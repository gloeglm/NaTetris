NaTetris
========

This is a Tetris-clone-hobbie-project made entirely in Java, using only javax.swing for animations. The difference from the original Tetris game is that this version is going to provide sound feedback whenever you score some points. And these sounds will be recorded by me. Wooohooo!

Also, they're entirely in portuguese, as this game was made having only my friends in mind. :-)

Feel free to make any changes in case you see the need. I do not think there are any issues around it right now, except for the sound (the audioclips overlap each other when you score too fast), which I consider more of a feature than a bug ;-) kthx
